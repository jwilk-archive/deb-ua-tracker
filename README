**ua-tracker** test-installs Debian packages to gather information about
alternatives_ they register.

The output format is the same as for Contents-* files,
which are used by e.g. apt-file_.

.. _alternatives:
   https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg/update-alternatives.1

.. _apt-file:
   https://packages.debian.org/unstable/apt-file

You will need:

* A chroot managed by schroot_.
  This *must* be a cloned chroot, because ua-tracker will make the chroot dirty.

.. _schroot:
   https://packages.debian.org/unstable/schroot

* List of packages that are suspected to register alternatives.
  (In theory, one could try installing *all* packages, but that would waste
  a lot of time, since vast majority of packages don't register anything.)

  binarycontrol.debian.net_ can be used to get the candidates.

.. _binarycontrol.debian.net:
   https://binarycontrol.debian.net/?q=%5Cbupdate-alternatives%5Cb&path=%2Fstretch%2F

* Fast Debian mirror (or alternatively, copious amount of time).
